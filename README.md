FancierForms
============

Completely styleable, jQuery-driven form element replacements (select, radio, checkbox) that work cooperatively with their native counterparts to mimic the expected user experience for both mouse and keyboard interactions.

NOTE: I have only implemented <select> elements so far. I'll be added support for radios and checkboxes soon.
